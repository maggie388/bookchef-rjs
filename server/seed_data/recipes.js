        book: 'Love and Lemons',
        page: '55',
        category: 'Breakfast',
        ingredients: '<li>1 1/3 cup almond flour, spooned and leveled</li> <li>1 tsp baking powder</li> <li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li> <li>1 tsp vanilla</li> <li>1/4 cup almond milk</li> <li>2 large eggs</li> <li>1 tbsp maple syrup, more for serving</li> <li>extra-virgin olive oil, for the pan</li>',
        instructions: '<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt.</li> <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the almond milk, eggs, and maple syrup.</li> <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir. If your batter is very thick, stir in a little bit more almond milk. If it\'s too thin, sprinkle in a touch more almond flour. (See photo in the blog post for batter consistency).</li> <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Brush the pan with a little olive oil and use a ¼-cup measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan. (Note: these are more delicate than regular flour pancakes so it\'s important to make them small). Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes per side, turning the heat to low as needed so that the middles cook without burning the outsides. I usually turn my heat lower after each batch as my pan starts to hold residual heat. Almond flour pancakes darken a little quicker than pancakes that use regular flour.</li> <li>Serve with maple syrup.</li>'

Serve with the reserved orange rounds and cinnamon sticks. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and cranberries, if desired.</li>'
